# Azure Movie Recommendation System

This project involves creating a movie recommendation system using Azure services, which includes the following steps:
```
1. Uploading movie data files from your local laptop to Azure storage
2. Connecting Azure Databricks to Azure storage
3. Writing Spark code in Azure Databricks to perform machine learning work to 
determine recommended movies for users
4. Running the Spark code in Azure Data Factory (ADF) after validating the 
incoming data files to ensure they have proper schema
5. Sending an email to users with recommended movies and a failure email if pipelines fail
```
